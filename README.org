* Introduction

- Design morphologically detailled cells for simulation in Arbor.
- Load morphologies from ~.swc~ and ~.nml~ (coming soon: NeuroLucida).
- Define and highlight Arbor regions and locsets.
- Paint ion dynamics and bio-physical properties onto morphologies.
- Place spike detectors and probes.
- Soon: export cable cells to Arbor's internal format for direct simulation.

This project is under active development and welcomes early feedback. Currently,
Arbor 0.5 is supported (and bundled with the project).

** Interactive Definition of Regions and Locsets
[[images/locations.png]]

- Rendering of cable cell as seen by Arbor.
- Define locations in Arbor's Locset/Region DSL.
  - Live feedback by Arbor's parser.
  - Well-formed expressions are rendered immediately.
- Navigate with 
  - pan: arrow keys or C-drag,
  - zoom: +/- or mouse wheel,
  - rotate: mouse drag.
- Right-click to 
  - reset camera,
  - snap-to a defined locset,
  - set the background colour,
  - tweak morphology orientation.

** Definition of Ion Dynamics
[[images/mechanisms.png]]

- Load mechanisms from built-in catalogues.
- Define ion species.
- Set parameters of mechanisms and ions.
- Set global and cell level defaults.

** Manipulation of Cable Cell Parameters
[[images/parameters.png]]

- Set per-region parameters like temperature, resisitivities, and more.
- Set global and cell level defaults.

* Installation

Please install a OpenGL package confirming to your choice and platform.

Then, clone this repository like this
#+begin_example bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/thorstenhater/arbor-gui.git
#+end_example
this will bring in all the requirements apart from OpenGL.

Next, configure and build the project
#+begin_example bash
cd arbor-gui
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
#+end_example
